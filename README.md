# ironman-athlete-tracker
An Azure web job that I busied up in the morning (UK time) before Kona 2016 so my tri-club and I could get updates about our friends on the big island without living on the Ironman site. Of course, they've released their own app now, so this is no longer useful and may not even work any more.

I have a note that subscribing to https://pushover.net/subscribe/IMTracker-4bydbzjegcn88g6 should get the notifications, but the job isn't running just now.

TODO: write configuration and usage notes for Pushover.
